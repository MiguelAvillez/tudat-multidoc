      Class for defining settings for the creation of a system of bodies. This object is typicall created from default settings, and
      then adapted to the user's specific needs.

            Name of the body for which settings are to be retrieved


  - name: BodySettings
    short_summary: "Class for defining settings for the creation of a single body."
    extended_summary: |
      Class for defining settings for the creation of a single body, this object is typically stored inside a
      :class:`BodyListSettings`, object.

    attributes:
      - name: constant_mass # [py]
        type: float # [py]
        description: Mass that gets assigned to the vehicle. Note that this mass does *not* automatically define a gravity field
          model, but is instead used for the calculation of non-conservative forces only. When creating a body with a gravity field,
          leave this entry empty.

      - name: atmosphere_settings # [py]
        type: AtmosphereSettings # [py]
        description: Object that defines the settings of the atmosphere model that is to be created. Note that wind model settings
          may be defined inside this object. A variable of this type is typically assigned by using a factory function from the
          :ref:`tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.atmosphere` module.

      - name: ephemeris_settings # [py]
        type: EphemerisSettings # [py]
        description: Object that defines the settings of the ephemeris model that is to be created. A variable of this type is typically
          assigned by using a factory function from the :ref:`tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris` module.

      - name: gravity_field_settings # [py]
        type: GravityFieldSettings # [py]
        description: Object that defines the settings of the gravity field model that is to be created. A variable of this type is typically
          assigned by using a factory function from the :ref:`tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.gravity_field` module.

      - name: rotation_model_settings # [py]
        type: RotationModelSettings # [py]
        description: Object that defines the settings of the rotation model that is to be created. A variable of this type is typically
          assigned by using a factory function from the :ref:`tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.rotation_model` module.

      - name: shape_settings # [py]
        type: BodyShapeSettings # [py]
        description: Object that defines the settings of the shape model that is to be created. A variable of this type is typically
          assigned by using a factory function from the :ref:`tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.shape` module.

functions:

  - name: get_default_body_settings # [py]
  - name: getDefaultBodySettings # [cpp]
    short_summary: "Function that retrieves the default settings for the given set of input bodies."
    extended_summary: |
      Function that retrieves the default settings for the given set of input bodies. Default settings are described in
      detail `here <https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_api/environment_setup/create_bodies/default_settings.html>`_ .
      Note that if a body is provided as input for which default settings do not exist, an exception is thrown. In addition
      to settings for each separate body, this function returns an object that defines the global frame origin and orientation,
    parameters:

    returns:

  - name: get_default_body_settings_time_limited # [py]
  - name: getDefaultBodySettings # [cpp]
    short_summary: "Function that retrieves the default settings for the given set of input bodies, with a limited valid time interval."
    extended_summary: |
      Same as :ref:`get_default_body_settings`, but with body settings valid over a limited time interval. This makes the
      the extraction of states from ephemerides more computationally efficient, at the expense of more RAM usage, and a
      constrained time interval over which the ephemerides are valid. See `this page <https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_api/environment_setup/valid_time_range.html>`_ for more details.
