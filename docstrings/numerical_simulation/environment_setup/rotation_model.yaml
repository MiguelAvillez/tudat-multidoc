  # base class:

  - name: RotationModelSettings
    short_summary: "Base class for providing settings for automatic rotation model creation."
    extended_summary: |
      This class is a functional base class for settings of rotation models that require no information in addition to their type.
      Basic rotation model has constant orientation of the rotation axis (body-fixed z-axis) and constant rotation rate about this axis.
      Rotation models requiring additional information must be created using the factory functions which create the specific object derived from this base class.

    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for settings object, defining a synchronous rotation model where rotation of a body is defined from its relative orbit w.r.t. some central body. Specifically
      - the body-fixed x-axis is *always* pointing towards the central body
      - the body-fixed z-axis is *always* perpendicular to the orbital plane (along the direction of
      .. math:: \mathbf{x} \cross \mathbf{v} )
      - the body-fixed y-axis completes the right-handed reference frame

    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for settings object, defining high-accuracy Earth rotation model according to the IERS 2010 Conventions.
      This settings class has various options to deviate from the default settings, typical applications will use default.
      Note that for this model the original frame must be J2000 or GCRS (in the case of the former, the frame bias between GCRS and J2000 is automatically corrected for). The target frame (e.g. body-fixed frame) name is ITRS.
      The precession-nutation theory may be `iau_2000a` / `iau_2000b` or `iau_2006`, as implemented in the SOFA toolbox. Alternative options to modify the input (not shown above) include the EOP correction file, input time scale, short period UT1 and polar motion variations.
      The target frame (e.g. body-fixed frame) name is ITRS.
      This function creates an instance of a `RotationModelSettings` derived `gcrsToItrsRotationModelSettings` object.
