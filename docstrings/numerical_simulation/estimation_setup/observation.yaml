    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for creating settings for a one-way open-loop observable. The observable is *approximately* equal to
      the range-rate between the link ends, divided by *c*. The full model one-way Doppler observable :math:`h_{D(1),AB}` from

      .. math::

      This observable represents the 'instantaneous (non-integrated)' Doppler observable, as obtained from open-loop observations.

      Factory function for creating settings for a Cartesian velocity observable. Note that this observable is typically not
      realized in reality, but can be very useful for verification or analysis purposes. This observable provides the inertial

      has size 3, and contains the :math:`x`, :math:`y` and :math:`z` velocity

  ############### LIGHT-TIME CORRECTIONS ################################

  - name: first_order_relativistic_light_time_correction # [py]
    short_summary: "Factory function for creating settings for first-order relativistic light-time corrections."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for creating settings for first-order relativistic light-time corrections: the correction to 
      the light time of a (set of) stationary point masses, computed up to c−2 according to general relativity as formulated by e.g. Moyer (2000). 
      One ambiguity in the model is the time at which the states of the perturbing bodies are evaluated. We distinguish two cases:

      * In the case where the perturbing body contains a link end of the observation (for instance perturbation due to Earth gravity field, 
        with one of the link ends being an Earth-based station), the time at which the Earth’s state is evaluated equals the transmission time if Earth acts as transmitter, and reception time if 
        Earth acts as receiver. 
      * In other cases, where the perturbing body is not involved in the link ends, its state is evaluated at the midpoint time between transmitter and receiver.

  - name: absolute_bias # [py]
    short_summary: "Factory function for creating settings for an absolute observation bias."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for creating settings for an absolute observation bias. When calculating the observable value, applying this setting
      will take the physically ideal observation :math:`h`, and modify it to obtain the biased observation :math:`\tilde{h}` as follows:

      .. math::
         \tilde{h}=h+K

      where :math:`K` is the ``bias_value``. For an observable with size greater than 1, :math:`K` is a vector and the multiplication is component-wise.

      Factory function for defining body avoidance observation viability settings. When simulating observations, this setting
      will omit any observations for which the signal path passes 'too close' to a body, when
      using the :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.simulate_observations` function. The definition of 'too close' is computed
      as the angle between:
      
      * The line-of-sight vector from a link end to a given third body
      * The line-of-sight between two link ends 

      This constraint is typically used to prevent the Sun from being too close to the field-of-view of the telescope(s), as defined by
      a so-called 'SPE' (Sun-Probe-Earth) angle constraint. The present viability setting generalizes this constraint.
