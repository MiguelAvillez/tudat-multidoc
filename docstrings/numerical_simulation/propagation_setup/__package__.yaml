functions:


  - name: createAccelerationModelsMap # [cpp]
  - name: create_acceleration_models # [py]
    short_summary: "Function to create a set of acceleration models from a dictionary of bodies linked to acceleration model types."

    extended_summary: |
      Function to create a set of acceleration models from a map of bodies and acceleration model types. The propagated
      bodies and central bodies are provided as two separate lists with the same order.

    parameters:
      - name: bodies # [cpp]
        type: SystemOfBodies # [cpp]
      - name: body_system # [py]
        type: SystemOfBodies # [py]
        description: System of bodies to be used in the propagation.

      - name: selectedAccelerationPerBody # [cpp]
        type: SelectedAccelerationMap # [cpp]
      - name: selected_acceleration_per_body # [py]
        type: Dict[str, Dict[str, List[AccelerationSettings]]] # [py]
        description: Key-value container, with key denoting the body undergoing the acceleration, and the value containing an
                     additional key-value container, with the body exerting acceleration, and list of acceleration settings
                     exerted by this body.

      - name: propagatedBodies # [cpp]
        type: std::vector # [cpp]
      - name: bodies_to_propagate # [py]
        type: list # [py]
        description: List of bodies to propagate.

      - name: centralBodies # [cpp]
        type: std::vector # [cpp]
      - name: central_bodies # [py]
        type: list # [py]
        description: List of central bodies, each referred to each propagated body in the same order.

    returns:
        type: AccelerationMap # [cpp]
        type: AccelerationMap # [py]
        description: Set of accelerations acting on the bodies to propagate, provided as dual key-value container, similar
                     to the acceleration settings input, but now with ``AccelerationModel`` lists as inner value


  - name: createTorqueModelsMap # [cpp]
  - name: create_torque_models # [py]
    short_summary: "Function to create a set of acceleration models from a dictionary of bodies linked to acceleration model types."

    extended_summary: |
      Function to create a set of acceleration models from a map of bodies and acceleration model types. The propagated
      bodies is provided as a list.

        description: System of bodies to be used in the propagation.

      - name: selectedTorquePerBody # [cpp]
        type: SelectedTorqueMap # [cpp]
      - name: selected_torque_per_body # [py]
        type: Dict[str, Dict[str, List[TorqueSettings]]] # [py]
        description: Key-value container, with key denoting the body undergoing the torque, and the value containing an
                   additional key-value container, with the body exerting torque, and list of torque settings
                   exerted by this body.

      - name: propagatedBodies # [cpp]
        type: std::vector # [cpp]
      - name: bodies_to_propagate # [py]
        type: list # [py]
        description: List of bodies to propagate.

    returns:
        type: TorqueModelMap # [cpp]
        type: TorqueModelMap # [py]
        description: Set of torques acting on the bodies to propagate, provided as dual key-value container, similar
                     to the torque settings input, but now with ``TorqueModel`` lists as inner value
