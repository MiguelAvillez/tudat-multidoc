  - name: createAccelerationModelsMap # [cpp]

    short_summary: "Function to create a set of acceleration models from a dictionary of bodies linked to acceleration model types."

    extended_summary: |
      Function to create a set of acceleration models from a map of bodies and acceleration model types. The propagated
      bodies and central bodies are provided as two separate lists with the same order.

    parameters:
      - name: bodies # [cpp]
        type: SystemOfBodies # [cpp]

        type: Dict[str, Dict[str, List[AccelerationSettings]]] # [py]
        description: Key-value container, with key denoting the body undergoing the acceleration, and the value containing an
                     additional key-value container, with the body exerting acceleration, and list of acceleration settings
                     exerted by this body.

      - name: propagatedBodies # [cpp]
        type: std::vector # [cpp]
      - name: bodies_to_propagate # [py]

        description: List of bodies to propagate.

      - name: centralBodies # [cpp]
        type: std::vector # [cpp]
      - name: central_bodies # [py]
        type: list # [py]
        description: List of central bodies, each referred to each propagated body in the same order.

    returns:
        type: AccelerationMap # [cpp]
        type: AccelerationMap # [py]
        description: Set of accelerations acting on the bodies to propagate, provided as dual key-value container, similar
                     to the acceleration settings input, but now with ``AccelerationModel`` lists as inner value


  - name: createTorqueModelsMap # [cpp]
  - name: create_torque_models # [py]
    short_summary: "Function to create a set of acceleration models from a dictionary of bodies linked to acceleration model types."

    extended_summary: |
      Function to create a set of acceleration models from a map of bodies and acceleration model types. The propagated
      bodies is provided as a list.

    parameters:

        type: Dict[str, Dict[str, List[TorqueSettings]]] # [py]
        description: Key-value container, with key denoting the body undergoing the torque, and the value containing an
                   additional key-value container, with the body exerting torque, and list of torque settings
                   exerted by this body.

        description: Set of torques acting on the bodies to propagate, provided as dual key-value container, similar
                     to the torque settings input, but now with ``TorqueModel`` lists as inner value


  - name: createMassRateModelsMap # [cpp]
  - name: create_mass_rate_models # [py]
    short_summary: "Function to create a set of mass-rate models from associated settings."

    extended_summary: |
      Function to create a set of mass-rate models from a map of bodies and mass-rate model types.
      If the mass-rate depends on any acceleration models (e.g. thrust), the acceleration
      models must be provided as an input.

    parameters:

        description: Key-value container, with key denoting the body with changing mass, and the value containing a
                     list of mass rate settings (in most cases, this list will have only a single entry)

        type: MassRateModelMap # [py]
        description: Set of mass-rate models, as key-value container, same as the settings input, with the difference that
          the rate settings objects have been processed into the associated objects calculating the actual mass-rate changes.
