        description: 
          Enum defining the reason the propagation was terminated

      - name: terminated_on_exact_condition # [py]
        type: Bool # [py]
        description: 
          Boolean defining whether the propagation was termined on an *exact* final condition, 
          or once the propagation went *past* the determined final condition. The choice of behaviour is
          defined by the termination settings provided as input to the Simulator object.
