  This module provides the functionality for functional environment
  objects and associated functionality. Specifically, it contains
  the models that perform computations related to environment models
  of natural and artificial bodies.

    short_summary: |
       Object that provides information on the reason for the
       termination of the propagation.

    properties: # [py]
      - name: termination_reason # [py]
        type: PropagationTerminationReason # [py]
        description: | # [py]
          Enum defining the reason the propagation was terminated

      - name: terminated_on_exact_condition # [py]
        type: bool # [py]
        description: | # [py]
          Boolean defining whether the propagation was termined on an *exact* final condition,
          or once the propagation went *past* the determined final condition. The choice of behaviour is
          defined by the termination settings provided as input to the Simulator object.
