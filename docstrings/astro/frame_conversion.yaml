    short_summary: "Function to compute the rotation matrix from inertial to RSW frame"
    extended_summary: |
      Function to compute the rotation matrix from inertial to RSW frame. The RSW frame is defined 
      by the state of a body w.r.t. to some central body. The x-axis of the RSW frame points      
      away from the origin, and the y-axis lies in the orbital plane, and is positive for in the 
      direction of the velocity vector (but is not colinear with the velocity vector, except for 
      circular orbits). The z-axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane, and completes the right-
      handed coordinate system.
    parameters:
      - name: inertial_cartesian_state # [py]
        type: numpy.ndarray # [py]
      - name: bodyState # [cpp]
        type: Eigen::Vector6d # [cpp]
        description: Cartesian state, in an inertial frame, for which the rotation matrix is to be 
                     calculated. Note that the RSW frame is defined w.r.t. some central body, and
                     this Cartesian state must be defined w.r.t. that central body (e.g. central 
                     body at the origin)

    extended_summary: |
      Function to compute the rotation matrix from inertial to TNW frame. The TNW frame is defined 
      by the state of a body w.r.t. to some central body. The x-axis of the TNW frame points      
      along the velocity vector, and the y-axis lies in the orbital plane, and is positive in the 
      direction away from the central body (or positive *towards* the central body if the
